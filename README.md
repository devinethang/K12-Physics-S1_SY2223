### 2.08: Significant Figures

Rules regarding significant digits:

* Rule 1: All nonzero digits (1–9) are significant.

* Rule 2: Zeros between nonzero digits are significant.

* Rule 3: Zeros used solely as placeholders are not significant. These zeros include leading zeros in front of a number or trailing zeros (those to the right of a nonzero digit) when there is no decimal point.

* Rule 4: All trailing zeros are significant if there is a decimal point in the number.

* Rule 5: Counted numbers have an infinite number of significant digits because there is no uncertainty in them.

* Rule 6: For numbers written in scientific notation, all digits are significant.
