* Workbook: [7-01 - Projectile Motion](7%20-%20Motion%20In%20Two%20Dimensions/7-01%20-%20Projectile%20Motion.xlsx)

#### Unit Questions:

* A boy throws a stone horizontally with a velocity of +20 m/s from the top of a cliff that is 44 m high. How long does it take the stone to reach the ground? What will the range of the stone be?

* A boy throws a stone with a velocity of +20.0 m/s at an angle of 30Â°. How long does it take the stone to hit the ground? How far will the stone have traveled when it hits the ground? How high will it go?
