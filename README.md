## 7: Motion in Two Dimensions

### 7.01: Projectile Motion

* Workbook: [7-01 - Projectile Motion.xlsx](7%20-%20Motion%20In%20Two%20Dimensions/7-01%20-%20Projectile%20Motion.xlsx)

#### Unit Questions:

* A boy throws a stone horizontally with a velocity of +20 m/s from the top of a cliff that is 44 m high. How long does it take the stone to reach the ground? What will the range of the stone be?

* A boy throws a stone with a velocity of +20.0 m/s at an angle of 30°. How long does it take the stone to hit the ground? How far will the stone have traveled when it hits the ground? How high will it go?

#### Problem Set

* "Physics: Problems and Solutions" - Problem Set 30


### 7.02: Uniform Circular Motion

* Workbook: [7-02 - Uniform Circular Motion.xlsx](7%20-%20Motion%20In%20Two%20Dimensions/7-02%20-%20Uniform%20Circular%20Motion.xlsx)

#### Unit Questions:

* A 70.0 kg man stands on the edge of a merry-go-round with a radius of 5.0 m. He is moving with a uniform velocity of 2.0 m/s. What is his centripetal acceleration? What is the magnitude of the centripetal force that acts on him?

* A 0.015 kg rubber stopper is attached to a 1.00 m string and swung overhead in a circle to make one revolution in 1.50 s.

```
Find the following:
• Velocity of the stopper
• Centripetal acceleration of the stopper
• Centripetal force exerted by the string on the stopper
```
